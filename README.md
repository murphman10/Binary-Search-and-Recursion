# Binary-Search-and-Recursion

- Create a file of at least 20 student records sorted by student ID.

- Read student records into a vector in C++ or Java program. (For Vector, refer to Section 7.11. For recursion, refer to section 20.6. program 20-9.)

(More detail of vector may be found in chapter 17.)

- Student records should include Student ID, Name, GPA, Student Address, and

a pointer which points to (10+) test scores for each student record located somewhere in the program or from a second file.

- Display the 20+ student records (entire record, not just ID) and associated test scores.

- Use recursive binary search to search three to-five student-IDs in the vector.

- Use recursive binary search to search a student-ID at the end

of the vector.

- Use recursive binary search to search a student-ID which is not in the vector.

For each search, print the ID to be searched and the searched result with

the found entire record.

For each search, also count the number of times the recursive binary search function has gone thru the recursion cycle. And print the count for each search.

Your program output must show proper information to be understood well

by the reader/viewer.

This project was created with hopes to provide a good understanding of recursion.
